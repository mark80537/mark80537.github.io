Lightly grease an 8\u0026quot; square, 9\u0026quot; square, or 9\u0026quot; round cake pan. If you use an 8\u0026quot; square pan or round pan, make sure it\u0026rsquo;s at least 2\u0026quot; deep.\nTo make the streusel topping: In a small bowl, mix the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt. Cut or rub in the butter with the side of a fork, two knives or your fingertips until it reaches a crumbly state. Set aside.\nTo make the cake: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\nIn a separate bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, beat together the sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla.\nAlternately add the milk and the flour mixture to the sugar/butter mixture, ending with flour. Add blueberries. Stir only enough to blend.\nPour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the streusel topping over the batter.\nBake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean.\nRemove the cake from the oven, and set it on a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Serve right from the pan. Or, to transfer to a serving plate, Loosen the sides with a knife or spatula. Holding the pan in your left hand, gently tip the cake out onto your right hand, remove the pan, and gently right the cake onto a serving dish.\n","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/recipes/blueberrybuckle/","section":"Recipes","summary":"","title":"Blueberry Buckle","type":"recipes"},{"content":"","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cake/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cake","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dessert/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dessert","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Mark Frandson","summary":"","title":"Mark Frandson","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/recipes/","section":"Recipes","summary":"","title":"Recipes","type":"recipes"},{"content":"","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rVideo Management Software #\rUse up to 64 cameras (webcams, network IP cams, analog cards, or your Windows PC desktop).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Roll pie crust into about a 12 inch circle. For a premade pie crust, this just takes a few gentle rolls in each direction to stretch it slightly. Cut 18 rounds out of the pie crust using a 2-1/2″ to 3″ round cookie cutter. (I used a biscuit cutter which is about 2-3/4″ in diameter. You can also use a glass if you don’t have one). I got about 14 out of the first circle and re-rolled the scraps to get the remaining 4 rounds. Press rounds into a greased mini muffin tin and smooth out the sides so the edges aren’t all folded over themselves. Edges should go up to the top of the mini muffin tins. Prick the bottoms with a fork so air bubbles don’t get trapped underneath the dough. Chill in the refrigerator while mixing the filling. Mix together corn syrup, egg, brown sugar, vanilla, butter, and salt until well-blended. Add pecans and stir to combine. Fill each mini pie crust with 1 tbsp filling. Do not fill past the edge of the pie crusts — a little crust should stick up above the top of the filling in each mini pie. The filling will bubble and rise while baking and you want to avoid it spilling over if possible. Bake for 25 minutes or until filling is set. If the tops begin to brown too quickly after about 15 minutes, you can cover the top with tin foil for the remaining time. After removing from the oven, check to see if any filling has spilled over the edge of the crust. If it as, and it cools like that, the hardened melted sugar will essentially glue your mini pies to the muffin tins, making it very difficult to remove them without damaging the crust. Take those ones out of the mini muffin tin while still hot to avoid that issue! Top with dollops of whipped cream before serving, if desired ","date":"3 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/recipes/minipecanpies/","section":"Recipes","summary":"","title":"Mini Pecan Pies","type":"recipes"},{"content":"This is a note yada yada yama\n","date":"20 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/hugoandblowfish/","section":"Notes","summary":"Versions for Windows, Mac \u0026amp;

Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish, roll dough pieces into small tight balls and place into the baking dish in rows of three. Cover with a damp towel and let proof for 1-2 hours. Brush with egg wash (egg beaten together with a splash of whole milk). Bake in a preheated oven set to 350F for 28-30 minutes. For the garlic butter, finely chop garlic and add to a cold pan with unsalted butter. Heat over medium heat. Sweat the garlic for 30 seconds and immediately remove from the heat. Remove buns from oven and immediately brush with garlic butter and flaky salt.
