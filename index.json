In a stand mixer bowl, add the dry ingredients. Add in milk and yeast mixture, the tangzhong mix, and a whole egg. Mix on low speed, scraping the sides occasionally. When dough starts coming together, increase speed to medium-low. Gradually add butter until incorporated and nothing sticks to the sides. About 5-7 minutes. Dump dough onto a work surface and roll into a tight ball. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or doubled in size. Punch dough down and dump onto a lightly floured work surface, and divide into 9 equal pieces (75 g each). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish, roll dough pieces into small tight balls and place into the baking dish in rows of three. Cover with a damp towel and let proof for 1-2 hours. Brush with egg wash (egg beaten together with a splash of whole milk). Bake in a preheated oven set to 350F for 28-30 minutes.

Lightly grease a medium-sized bowl, gently fold and place seam side down. Place a damp towel on the dough and bring to a warm area to proof for 1 – 1.5 hours To shape, punch the dough down then flour work surface Divide dough into six even pieces around 95 – 105 g To shape the individual buns, gently stretch flipped side down and fold to the center. Repeat this process for the whole segment of dough, then flip upside down. Rotate dough 90 degrees and pull towards you. Repeat two more times to complete rotation around the whole perimeter. Place shaped dough in a rimmed sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Leave 2.5 in of space or 6 cm apart. Cover with a similar-sized sheet tray that is flipped so that the dough will not dry out.
